# 01-Guessing
My First Game Assigment.
This is one of my first game assignments for my Game technology Class written in Python. The purpose of this game is to teach me about simple data types and control structures.
The player is asked to guess a number between 1 and 100. The player then has as many opportunities as necessary to refine the guess.  The game reports the total number of times tried.
